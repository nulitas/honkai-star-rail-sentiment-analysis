"Absolutely love it, even for the arts, animation, storyline, and gameplay are all to my liking. But has to take 1 star because even since update 2.0 everytime the cutscenes appear, the game keep getting stuck at the cutscenes and even if I'm waited the game will force quit itself. I can't even finished the quest because of it.",4,Positive
"Redo-ing my reviews, Dev is quick to answer issues here, which is fabulous. HSR is one of the games I enjoyed. You can use free units to carry you. I've been playing nonstop with refreshing turn base combat, cute story, and the best thing for me is that their main protagonist doesn't become underpowered or obsolete. I would recommend anyone who likes a modernised turn base style combat. üòä Note: if you're having crash issues or resources won't download, I fixed this by lowering graphic to low.",5,Positive
The title screen is unnecesarily heavy. Please add an option to make static title screen. Even the main game is not as heavy as the title/loading screen. I've played on pc since release but the mobile version is way too heavy.,1,Negative
"I have written this review just to address a fatal flaw with the game. So I am on the Jarilo VI, and i am doing the mission The Eighth and Final Rule. I go to Sampo's location and..... Sampo is nowhere to be found. I am extremely irritated because of this due to the fact I cannot progress with the game because of this simple bug. I may have to resort to resetting my progress but alas, please fix this",1,Negative
"After playing since release I've really gotta say that this is the best think the Honkai team has ever put out. There is nothing in the reviews that can explain to you how good the game is, so honestly just try it out. It's a bit slow in the beginning of the story, but the second you get to the first story location it just breezes by. My only issues are a SEVERE lack of spellchecking (alot of dialog is very messy) as well as your dialog choices never seem to match when you select.",4,Positive
"Well I have played Honkai Star Rail for a year now and can say that the story, game play and side quests are peak. The game is way more manageable in terms of farming and pieces (A.K.A relics). The updates and generosity of the devs is great and with every new event, game mode or mini game you get tons of rewards. I would say the game is quite F2P friendly (as an F2P) The story is amazingly thrilling and exciting along with the characters they present. Plus there are a ton of guides to help you",5,Positive
"I love this game! It functions very very well, about as good as the PC version. It does make my phone pretty hot but that's kinda expected for a game like this. It's very free to play friendly, and provides frequent updates and events. There are battle passes, free version then paid version, and paid version is very worth it if you play at least 2-3x per week. The devs listen to their playerbase and are frequently introducing new and highly requested QOL updates.",5,Positive
"Didn't even play, the registration for this game (on mobile at least) is nearly impossible to do. Then, after about 20 minutes of dealing with the bs verification, it froze on the loading screen for another 20 minutes. So, I had to update AND login again when I reopened the app. Let's just say I will not be re-downloading this.. only got it for Mistplay points anyway ü§£ & My response to the devs, maybe just fix it instead of trying to make me do more work ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm not changing my review clown",1,Negative
"Hi, this game is very good. The character designs are very very majestic and the gameplay is stylish. But here, i want to complain that i kept getting stuck on a dialogue, and the characters would glitch, the dialogue keeps continuing but everything froze. Please help",5,Positive
"You don't have to spend a dime to get characters. There's plenty of free in game currency that you get by completing story content/events. And those refresh every 3 weeks after every character banner event ends, a new one starts. If you're a f2p the hardest thing in this game is learning to have self control and not give in to buying every character that comes out. Only buy what character or character weapon you really want. Otherwise you won't get far with your team comp. This is a team game.",5,Positive
No way to skip dialogue or cutscenes! Drop rates are low (%1) and prices are high! I've completed everything but a few character missions and have only obtained 2 5 star characters! It Would probably cost $300 to get the guaranteed 5 star. It's really sad because I love this game but I can't afford to play it and the prices are so high it isn't worth the risk of not getting the banner champ (%50 chance after 90 pulls then it resets),3,
"In all seriousness, I came to this game because I'd hit a wall with Genshin and wanted a break. I didn't expect I'd love it this much. The characters, the story line, the fact that they're so generous with rewards and warps just make it amazing to play. It has massive quality of life improvements they should be implementing in Genshin. Great game!",5,Positive
"I love the characters' detail! And the map is very good with its beautiful view! They have permanent events and free 10 pulls every patch, It helps me alot when it comes to pulling for new characters with awesome designs and their kit is very enjoyable and creative. Hopefully that you will add new chatbox, phone wallpaper and allow co-op like Genshin Impact, so I can play together with my friends which probably won't happen since it's a turn-based game. But still, keep it up!",5,Positive
New update sucks! My game stucks randomly when I launch ultimates. I need to close the game and start the fight over again making It impossible to end some fights. This never happened before the update. I tried reinstalling and lowering the graphics but as of now it's still freezing. And how come we can't delete other language voice-overs and past quest residuals?,1,Negative
"Still one of the best mobile games I'ved ever chosen to download. A massive step up from this company's previous gacha title (I won't name names) that had so many problems regarding it's story, pacing and character development. This game continues to improve with amazing trailers and characters. I hope this game continues to go far as the gameplay loop is way more forgiving. Also, ever since the ""trail-blaze power"" increase and resevoir, the game immediately became at least a 4.5/5* in my eyes.",5,Positive
"Really good plot and battle mechanic, naturally the game has the gacha system, but if you don't want to use it you can play with basic characters and enjoy it, for me this title is the first game which give the console experience and the same time this is the game for smartphone",5,Positive
I'm a genshin impact player... I started HSR as rewards are pretty good compared to genshin... Yup but still there is a room to improvement when it comes to story little less engaging... I know I feel this way coz I'm from genshin whose storyline and lore is the greatest strength... Not worse or anything but still can be improved a lot... Otherwise it's awesome and please if possible share some of your rewarding sense to genshin üòÇi would stopped playing that long ago if not for their story,4,Positive
"The game is good and all, but the app keeps crashing whenever I reach the final boss in the swarm disaster v lol this doesn't happen to me when I play on my laptop but my laptop is currently broken. Please optimize the game for mobile, I know for sure that I'm not the only one who experiences this. So many technique points wasted. Sometimes, I even have to restart the entire run",4,Positive
great game amazing story cool characters one of the best games out . the story starts a little slow but when it gets going you can't stop or see what is coming next . and multiple game modes that give a reason to use every character . get it and enjoy,5,Positive
"overall impressive, but for avid turn based rpg player it's felt not complex enough and at times it felt too casual (i think its more fun if the char have a elemental weakness distinct from each other like the enemies and can be downed), other than that its remarkably good",5,Positive
The lore itself is just amazing! The characters look beautiful and I don't think any of them are overly sexualized they are cover how they fit their characters. Only some issues of bugs freezing but just put it on very low and it will be good to go!,5,Positive
"Well sometimes I wish I could skip the CG or Dialogue part, so annoying especially when you have busy day. Just imagine to finish 1 mission mostly takes hours with less fighting part (usually once). I think some dialogue part from side mission is unimportant and worth skipping.",3,
"5-star review for Honkai Star Rail! I love this game very much, it's genuinely one of my favorites. I never imagined I would get hooked to it. The character designs are anime style, top notch. The animations and audio is so damn good. I couldn't ask for a even better game to enjoy on the go. Good job and keep up the good work!!!",5,Positive
"Incredibly fun, great graphics and story so far, gridny but that's perfectly fine as I enjoy games like that, would love for this to become a game on Xbox, PlayStation as it deserves to be there, it would be perfect as a multiplayer rpg where players can interact with each other and edit their playable character, the trailblazer Hope to see it in the future :)",5,Positive
"The storyline and character development in this game is insane. The game deals with such a variety of emotions and themes. There is so much content from events to quests and frequent updates with so many interesting characters. You always feel valued by the game as well, the rewards are so good and it makes you want to play more.",5,Positive
"The game itself has no flaws that I can think of. So, long story short, it's amazing. However, what's not amazing is the punishment of being an android Samsung user. The loading screen is stuck on loop and sometimes the game crashes mid fight or just when I'm switching relics. It's really annoying even after doing the suggested fixes. Why must android users suffer? Please fix in 2.1 update.",3,
"Game is great. When i first installed, i played it day and night. But after you finish the main story, side stories, character stories, mini games, theres nothing to do except grinding mats and equips. Simulated universes are fun for a while, but after a couple weeks, it gets boring. You have to wait for updates for 2 months. And the game takes up over 20Gb on your phone. That is the biggest drawback. Other than that great story, characters, and Persona-like combat",4,Positive
"Honestly, I like this game a lot. The combat is fun and the story is amazing. Even building characters is not a big problem as the materials are easily accessible and beating bosses is much easier with an assisting character.",5,Positive
"I like that one too and it's one of my favorite games; the design, character's design, gameplay... everything is just perfect and the best thing is the STORY i just loved this game and was playing since release without having any issues, a comment can't describe my satisfaction. Thanks to the team for all their efforts ‚ô°",5,Positive
"""Honkai Star Rail offers captivating visuals, engaging gameplay, and a compelling storyline. While it occasionally suffers from minor bugs, its overall experience is immersive and enjoyable, making it a worthwhile adventure for fans of the genre.""",4,Positive
"Honkai: Star Rail is a very creative and imaginative adventure game with good and interesting story. We can get and collect characters to be in our team. They look stylish and have different clothing styles with also different weapons. We need to survive in this game and defeat enemies/monsters. Our team will help us to defeat them. It is very fun and addicting. Well, it is too addicting, but it's worth it anyway. Can easily entertain us. Would recommend playing! I'll give this a 5 stars!",5,Positive
"Love this game. I joined for the turn-based combat and got blown away by the story. There's lots of end-game content, story content, events, and more. The amount of detail that goes into crafting the environments and the little funny interactions you find is incredible. You never feel like any part of the game was made in a rush, or in a lazy manner. Everything the developers do is for one purpose: for you to have as much fun as possible. Thank you hoyoverse!",5,Positive
"It's very very addicting and you can have many characters just by playing it for days or seconds and it has good graphics, characters and places and it had a beautiful story line and of course my favorite character their is Mr ratio having big damage with his calk and of course to all who is having two thoughts on downloading this game , I will just say this game is 5 star for me because it's an amazing game hope you download and experience the same as me! üòáü•≥",5,Positive
"I just noticed that in Stimulated World, when making final adjustments on relics before the boss fight the game freezes. I tried restarting the game doubting maybe it's a phone issue but my phone is responsive and wasn't lagging. Btw I'm using Snapdragon 778G just incase. So, after restating attempting to make a final adjustment on relics. The game freezes again‚Ä¶ Probably it's better to let you guys know if it's an in-game issue so the other's won't encounter the same problem.",3,
"This game is a straight 5-star!! My eyes are blessed with the beautiful art, unique character designs, fluid animations, exciting stories, and last but not least is the addicting game mechanic!! The Penacony update is AMAZINGG ‚ú© I love how the story is not always happy and sweet, but also have some deep meaning and bitter truth. The story always caught me off-guarded because there's many plot twist in this game!! Very much recommended, I cannot wait for the next update~!!",5,Positive
"I love this game a lot! The story and characters are really captivating, the rewards are pretty generous, and the gameplay never really bores me. Looking forward to what the star rail team brings during their second year!",5,Positive
"I love this game however I do have to report a bug: One of the stages of Pure Fiction (the third one I believe) my game keeps crashing. I assume that it's due to the amount of follow-up extra damage it gets (I'm using Herta, Clara and March after all) and the animation is too much for my game to handle.",4,Positive
"One of the best turn-based Gaccha games I have ever played! The care that de Team has for this game is trully seen in the characters design, background story, voice acting and mechanics. The environment is rich and compeltely worth exploring. The pacing is good and not too much time consuming (which is great for a working mom like myself). I trully adore the characters and the story so far, and the free rewards are plenty. I just purchased the monthly pass to further support the team. AMAZING!!",5,Positive
"So I played genshin years ago and I wanted to start a brand new game I could actually fit on my phone as well computer so I started honkai I have been nothing but having such a great and awesome time. The story, characters, combat, writing, the trashcan lore ( one of my fav parts haha) it's a great game I would recommend to those who wanna step into a nice game turn based combat, lots of side quests and much more. And they are very generous as well with rewards which I appreciate! :)",5,Positive
"It deleted my accounts data. I love the game, but when I went to my play, my oldest account wasn't there. I tried to log back on, but it restarted me over. Please help me recover it, I was really hyped about this account. I've tried to email the game creators but i have no idea where to find it, the account was really important to me because it was the first game where i learned how to build teams.Updated: It's now deleted TWO of my accounts data, both completely wiped and restarted.",1,Negative
"Greqt game, excellent story and graphics. Even my old phone can handle it fairly smoothly, however there are some bugs that are really annoying! Whenever i use autoplay, the game freezes and i end up having to restart it, losing all progress on a boss. Fix please or compensation!!",3,
"A F2P-friendly gacha game with a fun turn-based combat system. It offers a lot of characters with unique designs and personalities, alongside an ongoing plotline. Whether playing casually for the story or optimizing characters for challenges, it's fun both ways. However, story updates are somewhat slow and relic farming heavily relies on RNG. With that being said it's still a much better experience than many others on mobile devices",4,Positive
"Everything is awsome! Love the game. Only complaint is the gacha system and the new swarm Update. I blame it on my luck but honestly, I've seen people who has EXTREME luck and easily breeze though the game. I'm f2p so I'm struggling especially with swarm. With IL released, he's now the best character to use in swarm. BUT for those who didn't get him, it's stupidly hard just to pass the first level of swarm. So, give us mercy and do something about that. Maybe make it atleast a bit easier??",5,Positive
"Every game has its theme / style for it's art and character design. I tried the game after seeing a debut trailer of a character, ""Constance"". I fell in love with HSR because there is something majestic about the female character designs/waifus in this game. There is something memorizing about their appearances and personality. Aside from the characters, the story is fascinating and the combat is enjoyable. I like this game, and don't necessarily enjoy turn-based combat.",5,Positive
"Amazing game, I really love it. The attention to detail make it feel really smooth and it seems like they put a lot of thought into everything, which makes it feel alive. However, new characters get released all the time, so if you don't plan on spending money it could be hard to keep up. Of course, if you plan well it's possible to get the things you want. The combat is simple yet good, and I like how each character brings something new to the table. This game has a lot to offer.",5,Positive
"It's one of the most amazing games I play. The graphics and the characters is amazing too, what I like about this is that the story line and rewards is catching for me, it got addictive because of the story line and the rewards you will get when you finish a mission and level up your TB.",5,Positive
"Great game! I adore the combat system and the story, getting the materials to draw characters are much easier to get than genshin. My codes don't work for some reason though, like when I used the ""starrailgift"" I never received the rewards and when I tried to reclaim it, it said I had already claimed it. Besides that, great game with amazing character designs!",4,Positive
"AMAZING game. Loving it so so much. The voice acting, the graphics, EVERYTHING. I'm dropping the stars, however, since the enjoyment wore off after Jarilo-VI, similar to genshin and mondstadt. Maybe tweak the difficulty of bosses or make a way to level characters better and I might return to the game. Love you star rail, but not right now.",2,Negative
"Downloaded this because I wanted to try playing on my phone with the progress I have on my PS5, so I create an account, try to link it, turns out you have to *create* the account directly through the PS5, because, for some reason, it won't let you link with existing accounts, so you HAVE to make one on the PS5, so I delete the account I just made, and now I have to wait 30 days for the account to get deleted to be able to try again. Amazing. Thank you.",1,Negative
"Used to love the game and play it daily for about 6 months. I have now come back after 5 months, but the game keeps crashing on the title screen while trying to download it. I've tried dozens of times. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. It would run quite smoothly before, but now I can't even access the game.",1,Negative
"best gacha ive ever played, and I've tried quite a few. honkai sinks it's hooks in with great turn based combat and deceptively complex team building. it is very easy to get a few weeks of quality gaming out of this because the resources are very generous throughout the story. Even close to end game I'm enjoying logging in for dailies and weeklies. Thx Hoyo for a banger.",5,Positive
"I LOVE this game. It's a turn based rpg that's limited compared to Genshin Impact, but I think that's what I like about it (think Final Fantasy X vs Final Fantasy XII). The art is beautiful, there are endless quests, and I haven't had to spend a dime to make in game progress.",5,Positive
"Very pretty, very fun. Tho i have issue with performance on my weak phone. Game runs ok with minimal graphics, something lags, of course, but no big deal. Pure fiction though... In the middle of the battle everythings gets so laggy, sometimes it freezes, sometimes app has to close itself. Not cool(. 5 stars cuz this game has Jing Yuan and soonly will have a Boothill.",5,Positive
"Awesome semi-open world game that is very enjoyable. I'm very happy that u don't miss out on rewards even though I don't have much time to play it on working days. Characters and well put together, lore is good too, combat is turn based but still requires strategy and depending on what characters you get, at times it doesn't feel turn based at all! Super cool game, great animations, highly recommend!",5,Positive
"The game has a good story so far. The controllers are quite simple and it's great because you can easily perform well on a mobile phone. The only thing I dislike is the amount of new content added is a bit slow paced, otherwise it good game so far.",4,Positive
"I don't know if it's my phone, or what but I keep getting softlocked randomly. It happens like once a day, which is really annoying whenever it appears because I have to restart the game again, but it's tolerable since it's only once a day but still why is it so often?? Also the game runs pretty smoothly on 60 fps with the graphics settings I picked, expect Penacony, but more specially the Golden Hour region which is noticably far less smooth.",3,
"This is how a gatcha should work. There's a great balance of grinding and free stuff to make spending money feel unnecessary, but without making it feel horrible. The story so far is gripping and fun, especially for Impact 3rd players. If you're a Genshin Impact player, there seems to be no connection besides the one obvious thing. Square Enix should take notes for Ever Crisis.",5,Positive
I love this game so much. I am disabled part of the community. I love this game! And the boss fights are hard but I either have to suffer and wait to level up and get the things I need or play the game. Love the story lines. Love the adventuring and I love playing as the characters. And I'm happy for who I am. I would sponsor this game with pictures and get people interested. And I'm just excited for more updates that they have and more in stored stories and fun to behold Aventure . ^~^,5,Positive
"I come back after 2.0 drops and every time I open the game it downloads files for a minute or two then freezes. Any input after that closes the game for no reason. Not sure why this is occurring as it never happened before 2.0. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, restarting AND shutting down my phone. Nothing worked. Pls fix :(",1,Negative
"This game is awesome!! All of the graphics, rewards, character designs and more. This has to be at least one of the BEST RPG game I have ever played in my entire life. This game is good and all but I have a complaint, When I first started playing HSR I noticed that whenever playing story mode or whenever I fight an enemy, my screen turns black and I get kicked out of the game only to be met with my home screen wallpaper. It has become more frequent when the Pencony update came out. Pls fix this‚ù§",2,Negative
"Super good turn-based game, VEEEERRRYYY friendly to new players + guaranteed 5 star on newplayer pulls. This game has good graphics no matter what üôå Love the story and the characters, bosses are not too hard to defeat as long as you know the system (easy to learn!!). Gameplay is also fun, cool maps + easy to travel, you can get many pulls from leveling up characters too! I love the animations as well and the attention to detail of many things, this game is very fun and generous to many things!",4,Positive
"I uninstalled the game last year after playing it for a month, but reinstalled it recently to give it another go. After getting the free Dr Ratio due to the generosity of the game devs, I finally managed to progress in the story and I love the game. It has been 3 weeks since I started playing but I have already dropped about 300 dollars, and I am looking to spend more. This is an example of a game done right due to the generosity of the devs and in return players will give back to them.",5,Positive
"Hello ,I have been playing hsr for a mouth now and I am constantly facing the problem of game stoping in between it's really annoying, since I have to restart the game every time it happens and trust me it happens quite often I have never faced this type of problem while playing genshin on my Android phone ,sadly I have to back to playing genshin if it's not for this problem I would have stayed longer except for this HSR is definitely the best turn based gacha out there love it 5/5.",1,Negative
"I don't have any issues about graphic, animation and storyline but this game is very difficult to play for a f2p person. Leveling characters is very annoying when there are too many items for farming only for one character. relics are also mostly garbage. the enemies are also not balanced with the world level especially the boss. it feels like punching wall with empty hands even though it's weakness break.it's a shame it's a good game but unbalanced unless spend big on content or something.",1,Negative
"Graphics, gameplay, story is all very good. 3 stars because the game does not support controller like Genshin Impact and it cost way too much to try for those 5 star characters and weapons. Furthermore it's just a single player game.",3,
"First of all I lost my save file after an update, That is unacceptable. But any how here is the review. The game jumps strait in with zero introduction to the characters and setting, with no build up at all, which is an absolute must in any rpg! The game looked good but feels like it's made for slow people. Its to simple, there is no wonder of what too do or where to go next, the combat is pretty strait forward and repetitive. I much perfer the turn based combat of a game like black clover M.",1,Negative
"Amazing game, especially the writing! It has interesting lore and great humor. Graphics and character designs are pretty. Also, it genuinely feels like creators care about the experience as updates keep improving the gameplay. Sadly doesn't have much multiplayer content yet (only a friend list, chatting and borrowing other people's characters). It'd be fun to interact with other players in-game a little more.",5,Positive
"For a gotcha game, Honkai Star Rail includes a high captivating story with professional voice acting and high quality animation. For these reasons, I believe Hoyoverse deserves some of the money it asks for in its in-game transactions. If you don't have a gambling addiction and can control your spending, this is truly a great game and totally worth your time.",5,Positive
"My HSR first kept crashing since the newest update but I manage to fix it by changing the compatibility mode in settings to normal mode and turn off shadows, source: reddit. My device is Samsung S23 FE. I don't have any issue in my other devices. I recommend this game to people with its overall great experience and lore given to players. Great character designs and interesting MC. Generous rewards and this games respects its players' time. You can auto your dailies too",5,Positive
"been playing this game for a while, and it's fun! the mechanics and the game itself is great, gacha isn't too bad (for me, at least. can't say the same for others) but i keep having this issue where whenever i enter a battle, mid-way through a battle, if i activate an ultimate (usually natasha's, but it happens to others too) the game freezes. the audio is still there but i can't press any buttons. i've had to reset the game just to get it working again. otherwise, no other issues with the game.",4,Positive
"Interesting story, great narration, and funny off quests are the glue for this game that keeps you pushing for more. The fighting is simplistic but fun, I beat the game effortlessly without spending money, which is a nice change to see end game content. Obviously is has to have grind aspects to it, but you will only see this when wanting to progress into the lvls 60-80. I would say that its easy to spend alot of money on this game given how well it immerses you, gacha games are highly unethical",4,Positive
OK so it's a great game so far has a really amazing and fabulous story as well my draw back now is why can't I change my skin color of my character to black and our mixed andchage hair style I really like the game but would love it even more if this was a feature.,3,
"The graphics are stunning and the story is good. Surprisingly in depth battle mechanics. Lots of fun little things to find around the various worlds. On top of that the Dev support is amazing. All that said, I could not care less about grinding which in turn results in struggling to progress.",3,
"great game with great gameplay and visual, the story is great aswell. However, the bosses in the game are too frustrating. Even with the best character and best builds, they barely do any damage to the boss.",3,
"This game is absolutely AMAZING. I've been playing this game since it came out, and it has never disappointed me. The character designs are phenomenal, and the lore is amazing. It's so interesting. I don't get bored on this game as easily as other games like this. The game play is also extremely different then from other games I've played. I think it's really unique and a lot funner to play. Updates are always super cool. This game is really fun and adventurous. I 100% recommend getting it.",5,Positive
"I've played it since launch now, and it is a fantastic game. Took some characters straight out of honkai impact 3rd and make it a whole different game. I love turn base rpg games and they really made this game works well. Overall, it's a solid turn base rpg with good storytelling. However, I have to decrease my rating due to the gacha being very frustrating, instead of going for something like Honkai Impact 3rd which separate the equipment and character pull, they instead stick to Genshin model.",5,Positive
"I love this game! I've been playing since it first came out as a download and I've been hooked. My only issue right now is the fact that I can't load it nor even download the game back onto my phone anymore (Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra) Its really frustrating that I can no longer play it on the go, rather then playing the pc version (which is perfect by the way).",5,Positive
Hands down the best mobile game overall or the best mobile rpg. The characters all look unique and interesting and the graphics are beautiful. The only con is probably the gacha but I have noticed that it's not that hard to get good characters from them and you get a lot of pulls for free. 10/10.,5,Positive
"""Switching Control Modes is prohibited during Tutorial. Please continue using controller or restart"" The game has poor design for controller at first start. Here I am using controller, and it pops up telling me to keep using controller and soft-locks me in a pop-up. Restart game, works for a bit, and then dialog again.",2,Negative
"I didn't expect to actually like this game as much as I do. I usually don't go for story based games, but this one is amazing. I love the fighting style and how the camera is fixed and angled. The voice acting is phenomenal!! Some of the puzzles can be a little hard but fun nonetheless.",5,Positive
"A glowing 5-star review for Honkai Star Rail! The game offers stunning graphics, engaging gameplay, and a captivating storyline. The diverse character roster and strategic battles make it a must-play for fans of the genre. However, a notable bug occurs when entering rooms, causing an abrupt blank screen. Despite this issue, the overall experience is exceptional, and I hope the developers address and resolve such bugs in future updates.And make it easy for change username!?",5,Positive
"Very good game, I love the characters, art, voice acting and story line. At first I wasnt sure about it since turn based games usually arent my thing, but the way they made it work is very enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing! Overall very happy about the game and enjoy playing it lots, though I dont enjoy how much space it can take up, especially on pc, but still would recomend to play it to anyone!",5,Positive
"i totally didnt start playing this game because i was simping for one of the characters- jokes aside, i think that they could add a feature where you can transfer the materials from a character which i‚Äôve used them on to another character, cause sometimes i just decide that i‚Äôm not going to use that character anymore but i‚Äôve already spent my materials on them, so i'd like kind of a refund system, or at least the ability to transfer the levels to another character. (sparkle please come home)",4,Positive
"Great Game, 2 stand users ( Clara and Jingyuan ) and a funny but interesting storyline. Turn based game could be improved a bit, but it's decent for a game that is new. I also love how unhinged some of the characters are during the story. Lastly, man those achievement names are funny.",5,Positive
"This was an easy 5 star for me before this whole issue of consistent crashes on my phone. The game right now is literally unplayable on my S22 ultra, which is a shame because this was literally the one game I used to play the most. Fingers crossed for a patch that fixes this ü§û",1,Negative
"Best RPG I've played so far, the characters, the story line, the game mechanics‚Äîare top tier. But, lately, I've been experiencing a bug where every time I do the story mode, or just talk to characters the background suddenly turns pitch black. It's been two months and it's still there, which makes me pretty sad because I can't admire the background.>< Hope this would be fixed soon!",4,Positive
"I LOVE HONKAI STAR RAIL- From the moment I began playing it, I became addicted. Each character more incredible than the last with the story even better, the graphics and designs topping it all off. Nothing is behind a ridiculous paywall and the gacha aspect is at good odds, especially when you come by a bunch of tickets early on. Overall, an amazing game I'd recommend to my friends. Personally, it's not glitchy, but that's just cause I play PC. I hope everybody else enjoys this as much as I did.",5,Positive
Everything in the game is Amazing from personal experience. i like the character design and the animation and quality are Actually better especially the Imbibitor lunae water scene! The rewards too are very good and the characters are fast and easy to build. the Lore is a bit suprising from all the events and things that are happening but it's also pleasing and well-written. i hope to see more of the game improving in the future.,5,Positive
"Apart from some minor problems , this is the most well balanced game i've played untill now . Its very fantastic and pure brilliance. The lore and main story just keeps on getting better and better every update. Its becoming as equal to a story of any world class movie. The controls are easy. The relics are a bit tough but also thrilling. The very endgame content is a bit hard but u can complete most of the game with ease. Totally love it",5,Positive
"The game is good... Especially at the beginning... But as it progresses... It becomes too hard and unbearable to continue even if all my characters are all leveled up... There's no way I can finish all these quests because I get stuck and can't complete the quests involving combat without upgrading my characters even more and I can't upgrade my characters because of insufficient items, I grew tired with this and I'll delete it anyway.",1,Negative
"5 stars for such a simple Turn-based JRPG - Gacha game. Animation and graphics are very good and fit well for the rest of Hoyoverse. Game combat is fine, basic, and simple. Higher level combat is not that hard to grasp and understand. The summon is where it falls off a little as you can summon 20 times and only get one or two 5-star units. You need to focus on either unit or vision card unless you go whale. The F2P is general good and should be able to finish with the units given.",4,Positive
"Idk where to report a bug, so I'm putting it here. I'm not sure if it's a bailu thing, but occasionally, when using her ult, it freezes the game, and then after a while, it makes the screen go black. I don't mind it much because restarting the game seems to fix it, but still, it's a little annoying.",3,
This a fun and addictive turn based RPG. There is so much so do and so much lore that it can seem overwhelming. It's really good for short or long gaming sessions. So far I haven't hit a pay wall which is a huge plus. This looks and plays great on my S23 Ultra at the highest resolution setting and at 60fps. Can't wait for the console version!,5,Positive
"I love the game so much all the characters are so pretty and the interactions in the game are fun too along with the story, though the only issue I have is the languages file whenever the new update is here for some reason the language files I had downloaded gets deleted and I have to re-download them again. It would be great if you could fix it other than that I don't have any issues. The story is fun too and this is my first ever turn based game so I'm not disappointed at the least.",5,Positive
"It's a great game, I love that it's turn based combat. There is a lot to do, I mean that both ina good and bad way. Graphics are very good, the sound, vibe, controls are all well done too. But the game is like 19 gigs. Bigger than some RPGs on my console games.",5,Positive
"The turn based combat system is boring. Getting to use only 2 attacks and an ultimate is not fun. There is no online play at all, so you can't have friends help you with relic and trace material domains. Support characters are boring. It's not possible to evade enemy attacks. You can't actually interact with the world. Endgame content is not F2P friendly. The game isn't open world and the maps are too small.",1,Negative
"The games a lot of fun and the characters feel unique to play. The only downside is the amount of energy you get to farm relics and trace materials is really low. Farming the materials takes ages, even at the heightest tier doing the 6 runs, you mostly just get 1 of the high grade you want.",4,Positive
"Really fun game, I especially love the management mini games in it, and wish there were more of that kind of content. The gacha rates are pretty fair and it's not bad for free players BC there's lots of stuff you can do to get gems. The characters, story and music are fantastic. Some of the area designs feel a bit empty in the first few areas but this improves as you progress. The UI can be a bit overwhelming when you are in the main screen but you get used to it after a while",5,Positive
"Played since day 1, and it's nearly been a year. Overall an enjoyable game with great story, however some mechanics such as repeatedly completing stages to farm for equipment and character leveling materials can become frustrating at times. Despite that, the game still has many other content to enjoy, along with unique bi-weekly events that provide plenty of rewards for character summons. Looking forward to what this game will bring in the future!",5,Positive
"I've been having issues issues since the last version was rolled out. The screen goes black. En when I am about to win a battle, the game freezes and I have to close the game. I never had any issues before.",4,Positive
Love this game really great characters. Love the design and everything about this game. Gives good rewards to players which is something that genshin could never do. If I had to say my only tiny issue with this game is that at some points in the story it feels like they rush certain scenes and big moments. But honestly IDC that much about that. So for me full 5 star.,5,Positive
"The game is nice, the graphics are good as hell especially with the cut scenes and designs of characters and their backstory, lore and the animation of both their skills and ult. I truly love Dan Heng's skill animations, Blade's and so on. Keep it up Hoyoverse!!",5,Positive
"I liked the game, but the constant crushing when in animation in battle makes me wanna play in pc than in tablet and phone. I suggest adding settings where we can turn off battle cinematic animation, ultimate, boss super attack, and other animation. This is an option for players with bad phones. I always get crushed in using ultimate.",3,
"I like this game, but sometimes there's this bug when I'm in the character menu and I'm switching relics, the screen goes blank with only the universe background. And when I click behind on android, it takes me to the regular play screen, but the UI just disappears. I have to restart the game every time this happens",3,
"This game excels in various aspects, making it a standout title. The captivating storyline is rich in detail and keeps players engaged, while the stunning visuals, especially at maximum settings, further immerse them in the world. Additionally, the well-designed character development and engaging material/relic farming mechanics offer players a fulfilling gameplay experience. Overall, this game is definitely a 10/10 in my book :)",5,Positive
"Edit* Perfect thank you!!!! That solution worked I've played this game for ages on my phone, but when it did its last update, the app just constantly crashes, I've tried uninstalling it and reinstalling but it's just doing the same thing. It's a shame because this is a really good game",5,Positive
"How come that a different team in the same company can get things so right in comparison? HSR has the best quality of life feel I've ever seen in any game, frankly. The story is amazing and thrilling, and the dialogue doesn't feel blown up. The rewards feel satisfying, and being able to go back to ""expired"" events is so lovely. The Genshin team should take some notes...",5,Positive
"Surprisingly generous. Events give good amounts of currency and daily missions are easy enough that its not a chore to keep up. The character designs are mostly super cool, the voice acting is phenomenal, and most importantly, the gameplay is really satisfying. Manages to feel fast paced despite being turn based. The story can be hit or miss but I personally enjoy it. Character building is timegated which is always meh but expected. Overall, very neat if you like gatcha games.",5,Positive
"This gacha game is very awesome!! I love the storyline, character designs and more! But even though I'd love to rate this a 5..The only problem is when I delete the app because of my full storage, and log in back to my account, all of my progress is gone:(( pls fix this",4,Positive
It is a really good game. There are tons of quality of life features in this game and the rewards are amazing as well. There is a lot of endgame content in this game so you will never be bored. There animations are really smooth and each character and every character is very unique. You will have fun playing this game if you love turn based RPGs. Even if you do not you should still try it.,5,Positive
"This game is great. There is a lot to do in the game, It may take some time to beat some missions in the later game, but you will get get there eventually. You just got to grind a little, I love this game. It has a great story, graphics, and characters, and it's fun. Now, I have spent a lot bit of money ($20) in the game, but you most definitely don't have to to progress. I don't know why, but I like this game significantly more than the other game called Genshin impact.",5,Positive
"Very nice experience, better than many other similar games. I am not very fond of the characters graphics, but that's a personal taste thing. I am deducting a star because of the insane size of the game. For an Android game, the fact that it downloaded 2 GB for a play experience of ~10 minutes and then it said it needs to download an additional 16GB... That is a bit much.",4,Positive
"It's a pretty great game. It still has flaws. The character design, animations, individuality, is amazing. It does a million things better than genshin. The amount of free wishes, an entire free 5 star, and other things is insane. The artifact system, while it is still a horrible system, is much better in this game. Exploring is much less tedious than genshin, although that is a pull for a lot of genshin players. The power creep is GOOD, it makes you satisfied no matter what you pull on.",4,Positive
"While I wish combat provided more options, HSR has surprising depth and building teams is significantly easier than in Genshin. Endgame actually exists, and the story is good but can be slow at times. My only gripes are that new characters can be hard to afford due to the release schedule, and that Simulated Universe runs could be sped up a lot.",5,Positive
"Freezes and crashing when loading screens whether it's opening doors or getting into battles. Fun experience though an characters / gameplay overall is nice like a star ocean feel , with an update I will continue to play .",3,
"Everything is perfect. Perfect to the last minute detail. Every character is just perfect in their own way storywise and design wise. The reward for events and other rewards is just abundant, please keep it that way. Thanks for such a good game that I can play during class so I don't get bored",5,Positive
"Best game I have ever played! I have tried and played at least 200+ games. I have gotten bored of them all excluding Honkai Satar Rail and 2 others. This is absolutely a fantastic game! Grrreeaaat story lines, with new characters, levels, worlds, equipment! It's ever evolving, in a good way. You can play this game for hours without needing to wait for energy to pile up or constantly feeding the game money! This is a tip top game that must be tried for any fantasy, Rpg or adventure game lover! A+",5,Positive
"Great game amazing graphics and art & story I can get invested in easily. Only thing I dislike about the game is how much storage it takes up I have to delete photos or apps every update. I also dislike how slow events go by, I finish the new story or mini games in a few days at most a week but then I have to wait for more then a month for the next one. These things prevent me from giving 5 stars but I still love the game.",4,Positive
"Most likely thr best Gacha game I've ever played. The story for this game is absolutely fantastic, it's not open world but it does have some aspects to it. The turn based game is also quite fun. Going through the story quests is really fun!! There is soooo many events ones that are permanent and those that come and go. And with the new update of penacony there is more content in the game. I've never had this much fun in a gacha game :D",5,Positive
"I love this game!! I love the story and how investing it is, I love the rewards system and events, i love the Fighting system and how you can keep things going in the background - i just really like this whole game. However, the game continues crashing out of the blue. Entering a battle? Crash. Finished with a battle? Crash. Swapping out relics? Crash. It gets agitating and really takes away from the immersion and makes me want to play something else. Its bearable, but it does ruin it for me.",3,
Download software extra files stop and refuse to restart if phone goes to lock screen or is interupted in any way forcing you to restart the app and also if this happens in game as well say you get a phone call it it's locks all touchscreen features again forcing a restart of app. Other games don't have this issue as you know being a game on the phone 99% of devs account for this. So needless to say I'm just uninstalling and playing/paying for something else that works all the time.,1,Negative
"Hsr is an amazing turn based game with many interesting characters and amazing story. But after the recent update, my screen has been freezing everytime I play. I tried exiting the game and clearing my memory but it doesn't work. Please fix this",3,
"I really love this game and I started to play it since the game server opens. But there is a bug in my game: I cant play level IV in the Spheroid level that's in the Hanu's prison break. When I enter the Spheroid, my game will crash and it'll be stuck in the screen. It still works like this if I force stop the game in the phone settings. Hoyo please fix this bug soon.",4,Positive
"Amazing game. This game has many events and quests await for us to explore. The lore is great, the gameplay itself is really fun. They provide us many rewards even if we just played the game for the first time. I especially like penacony update. This game is unbelievable. Genshin could never!",5,Positive
"I wish I could rate this higher. The gameplay is a bit vanilla, but so what? The lore is deep, the story is good, and the visuals and soundtrack are breathtakingly beautiful. If you're looking for a total experience rather than a simple game, look no further.",5,Positive
"I can't believe how good this game is. I consider this a masterpiece of F2P mobile games. I didn't play it for ages after release because it looked and sounded like another dodgy gacha. How wrong I was. It's super fun, with great characters, storyline, RPG development and gameplay. It's cross-platform and looks amazing on PC. It's a masterfully crafted game and I'm just sad I didn't start playing it sooner!",5,Positive
Beautiful graphics and cool gameplay. The best turn based action RPG I've played. And it's a mobile game!!!! That is sick. Mihoyo are gifting us with another beautiful game. The story is immersive and the characters are super cool. It may not be an open world like Genshin but it makes up for it by being more combat based. And you know: L+Ratio Genshin could never. üòÑ,5,Positive
"I've recently downloaded Honkai on PC, and the game is great! It runs smoothly, and the look and feel of the game is awesome. So, I decided to get it on mobile. The only issue is that while I could install it, after I tried to download load the 2gb of extra data, it would reach around 2-3% downloaded before the game would freeze. I waited to see if it was just loading, but it never went higher. Whenever it does this, if I click the screen, the game just crashes and closes. (This is on a S22+)",1,Negative
"this is a great turn based game, the story was amazing and so interesting but the game feels a bit.. rushed. theres a lack of content and most people have already finished the story. the graphics are also kind of wacky on android and the game keeps crashing in the middle of fights, its annoying but i dont mind it that much, it might just be my internet and/or device.",4,Positive
"I reinstalled the game because Ruan Mei's ult animation would freeze my phone every single time for like 10-30 seconds at a time at the part where it zooms out. I thought just getting rid of the bloat files like that would potentially fix it after the 2.0 update didn't. After reinstalling, however, the game now constantly crashes within a minute of me launching the game",1,Negative
I only downloaded this through mistplay at first but I enjoyed it so much I downloaded it on my pc and the graphics are even better on there. At first I was very confused so many things being taught in the tut. But you get used to it the fights do drag out a bit sometimes but it typically doesn't bother me. Will top up eventually that's how you know I really enjoy the game:D,5,Positive
"Just gonna say this cause you probably wanna know if this is a better version of Genshin (IMO it is). Daily missions are way easier, every update we get tons of rewards. Free 5 star for every players and he is actually an amazing character. The combat style is different than GI but it's more comfortable than I thought it'd be. Also our trailblazer/MC, in both genders, is TALL tall so that's a plus point from me üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Characters, Main story, maps are all great. 9/10 will recc.",5,Positive
"Love this app, only one negative note. Often times it will unexpectedly close the game altogether. It briefly freezes and sends you to your home screen. I do not recall this issue during earlier versions, Not planning on quitting but I'd like to see it get fixed soon.",5,Positive
"Amazing game, Amazing devs, 10/10. Game just gets better and better with each update. If you don't like turn based games, rip you lmao. If u think u won't like it because it has autoplay, autoplay is only for grinding resources, you can't use it in the story or for a full clear of the hardest content (MOC/PF). Only downside is, you can't skip dialogue just like Genshin. Annoying for people who can read fast or just want action rather than endless dialogue.",5,Positive
"Im actually having problems on downloading the game data needed to play, ever since i change my phone it crashes mid download making me having to download it again. That aside its actually a pretty fun game, the characters design is great and so it the world, very generous with the reward too.",4,Positive
Incredible... exceptionally well thought out... extremely fun!!!! The Animation is absolutely extraordinary (especially recently) If you love turn based combat this is the mostest perfectest game for you. You can play free to play but I loved it enough to support them financially!!! Hope you love it as much as I do!!!!,5,Positive
"Overall gameplay deserves a 5 star rating from me. However, I want to complain about something. Everytime I enter a battle, I often end up crashing. It's good that it doesn't restart all over again but it keeps annoying me that it keeps crashing",5,Positive
"Amazing game thats fun, has grest characters and is immersive. Edit: still think all of the above but ive been dealing with the game pausing and crashing during important story battles and now that i got a new phone im not able to even download the additional content needed since that is crashing too.",5,Positive
"Some new update has been making the game restart when trying to play the game. It happens a lot and even shows a unity engine error, I did reinstall the game. I can play but I mean the game suddenly quits when starting combat or just after starting after the train screen section. Happens like 2 out of 3 times. I have a Pixel 6 and it was running perfectly (sound and everything perfect) before one of the recent updates (Not the penacony one, I mean some little one done after it)",3,
"I have a good experience so far though, when I'm honest I mainly focus on combat and not really the story, it makes fun to play. I also like the element to choose autopilot mode when entering battle, if the team is leveled up etc. clears are easier which is a plus for me. The gacha system is a lot better too, and more rewarding. Talking about rewards after meeting the requirements given to you, it feels better and more rewarding than in other games . I can recommend.",5,Positive
"I had a great time playing this game for several months! It offers a lot of content but it's easy to fall behind and become overwhelmed. I hate to say it, but today was the day I decided to retire from Honkai. Thank you for the good times! It was fun to play during launch but it's too stressful now. Like Genshin, it feels like work and it feels like I will never catch up. Let us hide and dismiss missions... please!",3,
"This game's awesome, the team building has so much potential for strategies and is fun to work with. Unique combat system and mechanics adds another layer of depth. Penacony's story has been incredible so far and a lot of effort has been put into updates. Art and aesthetics are peak and has one of the best out there. Very casual atmosphere, I can play this for years without getting tired.",5,Positive
"I thought this was gonna be another cash grab gatcha game, with overly sexualised anime characters and endless pay walls. However I was genuinely surprised to see that is actually a very well made game! The story is slow but interesting, the fighting is simple but complex enough to require a bit of tactic at times, and the characters all feel fleshed out and interested. Pull odds aren't amazing, but they're not really required, and best of all they don't thrust half naked women in your face.",5,Positive
"While the gacha rates are still an issue, the game delivers a fulfilling experience and somewhat better rewards than GI (its predecessor), as well as QoL improvements, breathtaking scenery and music. As a turn-based title, controls are simpler and gameplay is easy to pick up. Also, the new [Penacony] region is impressive, love the many references to classic media and culture in the dreamscapes. Looking forward to future developments, but for now, highly recommendable.",5,Positive
"The best gacha game ever... Update, I'm having an annoyance problem in game that often happened when the game loading in the title screen, after battle, the game will stuck or lost server. It happened really often that I'm feeling depressed right now. Maybe it is because of the server overload but, please fix this immediately or else I will quit game.",4,Positive
"So recently I encountered a problem after the penacony update. When I play the game, it suddenly kick me out and I also can't log in for some reason. It happened so many time and I can't enjoyed penacony because it always kick me out when I play it. But still love the game ‚ù§ . I hope you can fix this problem soon.",4,Positive
"I quite enjoy the game, and it runs well, but I'm experiencing semi-frequent crashes without any known cause on the Google Pixel 6. The game will randomly close during an action. EDIT: From 3 to 2 stars. The crashes keep getting more frequent, and has crashed multiple times upon starting the game.",2,Negative
"I would rate it at least 4 stars; 5 stars if the RnG and pity system gets better - but until the mess is fixed - for now, I'll just give 2 stars for the game being awesome and has great music - gameplay experience has been ruined by the latest update for crashing all the time when entering a battle sequence on Android 14 (device: Oppo Reno 9 Pro Plus with the most recent ColorOS update) - never had that issue with the previous version of the game.",2,Negative
"Looks and plays amazing. I'm hooked. I think hoyoverse need to work on more realistic model movement during conversions and more diverse character shapes. All the girls look amazing but at the same time, generic. That aside, i hope star rail lasts a really long time and is supported as much as genshin impact. After looking at some 1 star reviews, they're not to be taken seriously in my opinion unless you are short on hone memory then it could cause your game to crash",5,Positive
"I've been playing since launch. I get it. It's a gacha. But it's one of the best, with higher rates and bad luck protection. The story is phenomenal. Of the majority of games I've played, few have made me laugh like Star Rail. I love the characters (Himeko FTW) who each have superb voice acting and fun playstyles. However, HoYo, please please please adjust Fu Xuan's skill buff icon to always be at the front like Blade's. The flow of combat gets broken every turn having to check ;~;",5,Positive
"I love the turns mechanism, also, the story is so well developed and interesting that makes you wanna keep playing, not to mention the peak designed characters and their individual and unique animations. I have been playing since it released and never felt disappointed, in fact, the game development keeps surprising me. Currently one of the best gacha games available in my opinion! It's impossible not to feel attached to the characters.",5,Positive
"I find this game completely beautiful, the characters, the landscape, animations, ulimates. it's all just so beautiful. I find this game so much more fun & easy to get investive in than Genshin when I used to play Genshin I dreaded farming for artifacts, and farming for characters because the process was so long and not fun (in my opinion) , but with Star rail, the experience is not completely dreadful, and it's actually quite fun. Definitely an improvement since Genshin.",5,Positive
"It's a very fun to play game!!! I love every single detail of the game, how the story and plot twist went, even to adventuring around the map to finish the mission and get all the chest and rewards!! Even loving it when every update gave you a free 10 pull, isn't that amazingüòçüòçüòç The quality will depends on the user's phone/PC. So maybe some of the time, there will be some parts of the maps that will not load and just a black screen like. But it's still a very fun RPG game to play!!",5,Positive
"Music on point, turn-based combat is fun/simple too easy to understand, impressive endgame content, decent characters, lack of a full character reset option that would cost about 60 stellar jades, we could pass their materials to other's would be nice, a bit buggy keeps closing me out when entering combat sometimes, would love to a proper relic loadout, hoping for a well deserved anniversary compensation for all the players who support this game, plz add a better hoyoverse login option on the PS",4,Positive
I mean this is a full game pretty much. Cutscenes voice acting a whole story. Turn based combat but a little more interesting. BUT it still is a mobile game and is very mobile gamey in a few ways. You can play without worry about it for the most part though. Yes cloud save no achievements,4,Positive
Everything about this game is really awesome in scope and ideas. The only thing more awesome is the size of this latest resource download: 24G!!! That's almost half my interval storage! I love this game. Everything about it. My phone just cannot handle that much info and still be a phone. What a bummer. I'll try to get a deeper phone. Hope the game continues to be a success. Cheers!,2,Negative
"I played it. It was fun for a free to play game but it is very you have to pay or it's going to be a way worse of a time. I think if they gave a bit more chances for free to play it would be nice. Also, they're free 80 pulls was a lie from what I can tell cuz I've been playing this for like months and I've counted how many poles I've got 25 pulls in the first month and I had to get the stellar Jade to do that. But I didn't get any free pools from the advertisement that they said",3,
"Love the story, good gameplay but severe performance/optimization issues on one of Samsungs newest phones - S23 FE. Sometimes major lags in battles, especially against Stellaron Hunter Sam. Audio keeps playing but interface lags, tapping ults or attack takes 10,15 seconds for it to display the animation etc so a very poor experience in this update overall as earlier after updating for this version, I could not even sign in as game crashed at validating rss but it was fixed later with support.",3,
"Amazing game, good quality, no lagging, the storyline is amazing. There are many characters you can collect along the way and gain through quests and the story line and very easy to collect money and gain character tokens. Does take around 30 - 1 hr or maybe more to download depending on what device you're using and how much space you have, but I promise it is worth it.",5,Positive
"Really good game but there's a glitch where I can't open up the notices. I told customer service but it absolutely did not help. I tried everything I could but nothing works and every other solution requires a laptop that I don't have. PLEASE fix this, it's super annoying!! update. I HAVE CONTACTED CUSTOMER SERVICE SEVERAL TIMES. FIX YOUR GAME.",2,Negative
Great game. Stunning graphics and I love the MC's personality. He/she got more character than most games's self insert MCs. Auto battle makes grinding takes way less time. The only downside is that HSR takes so much storage space. I wish there's an option to delete data from contents we have played (like main story's voice data and cutscenes). It's not like we can replay it anyway.,5,Positive
"I like this with all its stories,characters and trashcan lore. The animation is amazing and there are lots of rewards so there is no need to spend money to get any character. The only reason I am giving this a 4* and not a 5* is because after the recent update the game just crashes after playing for few minutes and I have to reopen it which is very annoying. I hope that this issue can be resolved quickly.",4,Positive
"Great game! Love the story and sidequests along with the characters, along with the setting being space!! My only gripe, and the reason why it isn't five stars is that whenever I come back to it, it always asks to do download data. Maybe change it from happening all the time to once a month, and it'll earn that 5 star from me. Thank you for creating this awesome space rpg, hoyoverse, but I don't see the point of asking for downloads every time I boot up the game.",4,Positive
"Been playing for months and have to say it has one of the best turn based battle systems i have ever seen in a game. It has a much better free to play model than others i have played. Its grindy but i dont mind that the story is pretty good with regular updates to it, good voice acting and nice charater designs. Hard and fun end game content to keep you interested. If you like the older turn based final fantasy games you will like this a lot i think.",5,Positive
"Wow. I never leave reviews but have to for this one. I get paid to bug test games, and since owning a smart phone, this is the best game Ive ever played on one, and its free to play. I'm really not into these type of Japanese/'weeb' style games but this is something else. The graphics are amazing, the cut scene and real-time graphics are the same. The story and characters are great, amazing design & dialogue choices. Do not sleep on this game.",5,Positive
"Hey hey hey! After the penacony update the game crash is becoming more common like it literally proc every 30 minutes. This is getting more annoying every single time. I'm already playing the game in low resolution,fps whatever the thing that drops the game graphics, the crash still persist. That's the only thing I'm experiencing right now pls fix this üí©.",3,
Fun game play. Great battles. 4 stars because I deleted it. After a while the storylines becomes overly long and needlessly complicated. I just played 2 hrs on a storyline and battled a total of 20 min. It lost my interest. Ya I could do the daily battles for something to fight. But to be honest that gets boring. But overall a great game just not for me.,4,Positive
"Absolutely beautiful game that continues to improve each patch. I never leave reviews, but Penacony has some of the best writing in any game I've ever played. Beautiful themes and messages and you can really tell the writers worked really hard! In terms of gameplay, HSR is a turn-based gacha that is generous in its rewards and difficulty without ever being ""too easy"". I tend to avoid gachas if I'm not playing it within a month of its release, but this game is 100% the exception!",5,Positive
"its overall an amazing game! Its not to my personal liking of games, but I can tell the devs definitely did this game right! I do sort of wish there was a recap thingy where you can see whats happening in the story and whats happened so far. i used to play the game but then I stopped for a solid.. little less than a year? I dunno. I started to play again but I sort of forgot what the story is about.. and I dont wanna waste my rpogress and make a new acount either. its not mandatory, but recap?",4,Positive
"Highly recommend. You can spend money, it's a gacha, but you actually don't have to. It's not pay-to-win - it's pay-to-win-HARDER. I recommend buying the 5 dollar monthly supply pass, IF you'll log in daily. Super high value. And also the $10 seasonal pass, which comes out every 45-60 days or so. Not required, but also super high value. If you'll play sporadically, do neither. It's a game with depth. Gearing okay is easy, but gearing well is where you could spend a long time. Anime quality!!",5,Positive
"Great game. Fun gameplay. Is still a gatcha game at its core. So you will be tempted to spend money here and there if you want a certain character. But ill admit that they give you plenty of free pulls throughout the game and the events along with future patches. Overall, you can still have fun if you wanna come in free to play. But you will have an easier time if you do spend money to get more character pulls or pull the same character several times to make them stronger.",5,Positive
"The storyline of this game is very good and the characters provided are also very interesting in terms of design and abilities. Even though the players are F2P, lots of prizes are given every time there is a new patch or from events. Indeed, even though many enemies are very difficult to defeat, if you have a good strategy there will be no difficulty in defeating the enemy. Hopefully the stories to come will be better",5,Positive
"Since the 2.0 update this morning, the game stutters and lags really hard when loading, and after a couple of seconds, crashes. Worked perfectly just yesterday and gives no problems on pc. I wanted to send a bug report through the game, but I can't. I will provide any necessary info to fix this.",1,Negative
"The gameplay, art style, characters, rewards, are great, better than genshin lol. But a major problem for me while playing on my phone the cutscenes lag for no reason it's been a problem since the 1.3 update I don't really know how this problem occurred but I hope the devs could fix the laggy cutscenes this would've been a 5star review if it wasn't for the mentioned lag",4,Positive
"Its a fun game don't get me wrong, however they really need to implement either increased rates or decrease AP cost for certain materials/ exp items on certain days of the week, and not just once in a blue moon. Because honestly speaking, grinding for upgrade materials and exp in HSR is overly tedious and takes too long even for just 1 character... And if you say ""oh we got aether fuel"" that just gives you back 60AP not even full AP....",3,
"I love the game, I haven't experienced any bugs yet, but since the game is in it's first stages, bugs are bound to happen. Overall, the graphics are top tier, the voice acting is really good, the story line, the playstyle, and the characters are really good. I recommend this game if you like gacha games.",5,Positive
"Simple but satisfying turn based gameplay, the only content that is time-gated behind ""energy"" is level up materials and gear; both can be attained at a steady pace as you proceed through the story. 5 star characters aren't necessary to beat main game but you'll get a bunch anyway as long as you play the events, do quick simple dailies, and do weekly challenges that have increased in # of levels. Higher levels are now more difficult for those who want a challenge.",5,Positive
Great game. I use the mobile version doing my dailies before I sleep but the new update made it impossible to even get into the game. It freezes every single time during the verification process after downloading. It's iterally unplayable right now.,2,Negative
"One of the best RPGs in 2023, and this is coming from someone who normally hated turn-based game. Auto combat means any grind fo materials can be completed without player's input, allowing you to do other things while grinding (provided your team is strong enough). Simulated universe is a fun rogue-like dungeon crawler with unique buffs and random event (that may or may not help/harm you) that challenge the player to strategize to win. Highly recommended.",5,Positive
"Best Gacha Game To Play. Honkai Star Rail"" is a captivating mobile game that seamlessly blends stunning visuals, strategic gameplay, and an engaging storyline. With its impressive character design and diverse combat mechanics, players are drawn into a rich and immersive gaming experience. The game's innovative features, such as the ""Star Core"" system, add depth and complexity, keeping players invested in mastering their strategies.Overall, ""Honkai Star Rail"" is a must-try for fans of the genre.",5,Positive
"I absolutely love this game so far! Which sucks, because I keep encountering a problem with the game crashing. It can happen randomly, or when I engage in npc dialouge. Everything else is perfect, and I will change my review to 5 stars once it is fixed! I can not stress enough how about I recommend this game even with that problem.",2,Negative
"Indeed, it's a very good game. It would be 5 stars if it's not ""some parts of the map are glitching"". What I mean is, for example, at the xianzhou luofu where some of the water color is black and it's kind of annoying. It's probably cause of my device, but please make it more device friendly.",4,Positive
"The experience is wonderful as you play through the story, seeing many different characters with stories that connect to the story of the place they are living. There are many worlds that are to be explored as updates come out, but there is plenty of content even now. The turn based gameplay is polished with many ways to form teams with existing characters and characters to come. This game has a bright future ahead and I intend to see it through",5,Positive
"I'm only giving it 4 stars due to a few gripes I have with this game. First being the difficulty spike. I'm all for difficulties being increased, but I'm not a fan of damage sponged enemies in turn based games. Even with the corresponding weaknesses and my characters being built, the enemies are too tanky. This gets pretty annoying in pure fiction and MOC, where there's a limit on how many turns you have. Second being what it does to my phone. This game turns my phone into an actual furnace.",4,Positive
"One of the best turn based game ever. I never imagined I would get hooked to it. The character designs are anime style, top notch. The animations and audio is so damn good. There's 4 different voice over to choose from, very inclusive. Not too lengthy but repetitive farming to build characters. Events are very good though. Plenty of rewards, very F2P friendly. Love it.",5,Positive
"Normally I don't leave ratings, but this game is solid. While I do have some gripes, it's clear the developers take user feedback into account, and nearly a year into playing it, I find that in all aspects (writing, character design, UI, music, mechanics) you can tell it was made by people who were happy to work on the project and are doing their best. You can also put it down and play it later with incredibly minimal FOMO. Also, great humour and an incredibly relatable main character.",5,Positive
"I love this game very much, it's genuinely one of my favorites. but there's only one issue. whenever cutscenes play, the audio will experience an audio distortion (?) and it'll lag. the cutscenes run just fine, but the problem is the audio. i rlly hope you guys can fix this as soon as possible, thank you. an update here, now even the cutscenes lag. please fix it it's annoying ngl",3,
"I really love this game as it has a stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and a compelling storyline. The character design is also exceptional, and the turn-based combat system offers a strategic depth. With regular and quality of life updates, I couldn't ask for a even better game to enjoy on the go. Goodjob to the Devs and the team and keep up the good work!!!",5,Positive
"Picked it up on the second phase of 1.2, and so far, this has been one of the best mobile games I have ever played. Turn-based RPG with mechanics that keep it fresh and engaging, that also get revolutionary with every new character bringin in new mechanics. QoL has been great, and while the Relics are still as random as ever, the development team is much more receptive and understanding, that makes me want to respect the game even more. I fully support the game, and if ever needed, criticise it.",5,Positive
Fun game that you can pick up and play anytime. The game might look simple as it's a turn based game but there are a lot of factors and methods that you can manipulate to get the edge over tough bosses. I do however think the equipment system needs some work. I spend so much energy in farming equipment but most of the time am left empty handed.,5,Positive
"Best online service game so far! The improvements in 8 months as they choose to add more endgame content, Good & fun storyline, F2P friendly, Fix many UI problems, and listen to the players' critics. This game is amazing, and I enjoy playing since day one Some problems I have would be Xianzhou storyline being rush and wasted the potential it has. The pacing was messy and Dan Heng story could have been handled better. Hoping Penacony would handle their story better as it shown to have potential",5,Positive
"Laugh, cry and more... I came to this game for the battles and stayed for the story. The voice acting adds depth to characters and the script displays the diverse communication from myriad people. The visuals are stunning and the 3D environment can be augmented when you have different tasks (dog scent, memory). The learning curve is managed well. The battles are fast and varied enough not to become stale. The controls are suitable for a phone. For a mobile game, this is truly breathtaking.",5,Positive
"It works flawlessly.. well, might need a tweak since reaching Equilibrium level 1 is pretty hard for newbies, my progression got stuck since I reached a dead-end with these item and character leveling. (It's probably an issue from me) Also the fact that the graphics seems to have been glitched a little, the in-game objects are bugged that they only shows the low-poly/quality one regardless of graphic settings. (Playing it on Custom-High and once try to maxed it out, it doesn't fix the issue)",4,Positive
"It combines parts of Honkai Impact 3rd and Genshin Impact, as well as years of player feedback, to create a game that rivals them both. It has the best QOL of any game I've played yet. Good dialogue-to-combat ratio. The endgame modes (yes, plural) are challenging yet rewarding, and the turn-based combat gives you time to plan out your strategies instead of frantically mashing buttons. Plus, some events are ""saved,"" so people who were not around yet or took a break can experience them too. 10/10.",5,Positive
"Good story, character designs are clean, the graphics are so good, and the animations are just spectacular. And most importantly, unlike genshin impact, honkai star rail is so generous when it comes to rewards. It always blew my expectations away cause it keeps getting better each updates. But the thing is, I wish there were more contents in the game to help me keep playing the game. But other than that, this game is an amazing game and i fully recommend this game",5,Positive
"I like this game and would love to continue playing it. However, there's some things keeping me from doing so. 1) The floor and walls keeps flickering everytime and makes a very distracting disco party. 2) I haven't played the game for like, 1 day and when I do, the game lags and takes a longer time than usual to load before unexpectedly shutting down by itself. 3) Similar to the former, the train looks like it was cut in half and someone took a bite out of it.",4,Positive
"It's a great game that I enjoy playing. It's the second hoyoverse game that I've installed after Genshin Impact and I love both of them. The stories, the designs and the characters are awesome. But there's just one issue I have and that is very very low quality of the screen. See, I have Genshin Impact on this device too but the quality isn't THAT low like the way it is here. Please fix it. The streets, the houses and the whole environment isn't clear at all. Overall thanks for the effort.",4,Positive
"Love this game alot. Greatly exceeded my expectations, the story is fun and immersing, the way the story is told makes it 100% more fun, which is a problem i always had with this kind of games. The voice actors are amazing , the fight system is OK too, not usual but it's not as bad as I thought it would be , it's exciting sometimes even. 5‚òÜ Edit: combat system is sick, one of the best features in the game, it's engaging and thrilling. I would even search videos of people in hsr combat. LOVE ITTT",5,Positive
"Its pretty good game and fun to play, but not for long time. It just feel so much less something to do in game after finishing the event. The event also feel too quick to finish and without 'realy' exploring feature, this game just nothing and kinda bored to being 'just that game you play'. But overall the animation, story and design is very awesome",5,Positive
